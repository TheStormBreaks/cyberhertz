          <p className="text-lg font-medium mb-6">
            As we navigate through 2024, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve rapidly with new threats and technologies emerging.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">1. Rise of AI-Powered Attacks</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence has become a double-edged sword in the cybersecurity realm. While it enhances defensive capabilities,
            malicious actors are increasingly leveraging AI to develop more sophisticated attacks. We're seeing a significant rise in
            AI-generated phishing attempts that can mimic legitimate communications with alarming accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations must implement equally advanced AI-based security solutions that can detect these nuanced threats.
            Training employees to recognize even the most sophisticated phishing attempts remains crucial.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">2. Quantum Computing Threats and Opportunities</h2>
          <p>
            As quantum computing advances, traditional encryption methods face unprecedented challenges. The theoretical ability of
            quantum computers to break current cryptographic standards has led to a race for quantum-resistant algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forward-thinking organizations are beginning to implement post-quantum cryptography solutions, preparing their systems
            for the quantum era. This transition requires careful planning and execution to avoid disruption.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">3. Expansion of Attack Surfaces</h2>
          <p>
            The proliferation of IoT devices, cloud services, and remote work has dramatically expanded potential attack vectors.
            Each connected device represents a potential entry point for malicious actors, creating significant challenges for
            security teams trying to maintain visibility across increasingly complex networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zero Trust architectures continue to gain traction as a response to this challenge, requiring verification from anyone
            attempting to access resources, regardless of their location relative to the network perimeter.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">4. Regulatory Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            Governments worldwide are responding to cyber threats with more stringent regulations. The landscape of compliance is
            becoming more complex, requiring organizations to navigate various regional and sector-specific requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this regulatory evolution aims to enhance security, it also creates compliance challenges that demand considerable
            resources. Organizations must stay informed about relevant regulations and implement comprehensive compliance strategies.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The cybersecurity landscape of 2024 presents both challenges and opportunities. Organizations that stay informed about
            emerging threats and adopt proactive security measures will be better positioned to protect their assets and maintain
            stakeholder trust.
